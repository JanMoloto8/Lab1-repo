            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Jan Moloto I was born in Limpopo at a small village of Lephalale called Ditloung.<br>
                I am now in my third year of Computer Science at The University of The Witwatersrand,which has gotten more interesting for me.<br>
                I like to sing in a choir at my spare time to move me away from reality.

            <h3>Latest Project</h3>
            <p>
                I developed a password encryption and decryptilon tool in Python, which aims to improve security by shifting <br>
                characters in the alphabet, based on a user-provided password and a shift key. The main function is encrypting <br>
                a message by moving characters forward and backward in the alphabet according to the specified value, which is <br>
                derived from the password.
